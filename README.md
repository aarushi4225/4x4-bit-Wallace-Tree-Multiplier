# 4x4-bit-Wallace-Tree-Multiplier
High-speed and efficient binary multiplication for digital systems.

---
## Features

* Multiplies two 4-bit unsigned numbers (`a` and `b`).
* Produces a correct 8-bit result (`out`).
* High-speed architecture based on the Wallace Tree method.
* Modular design using basic `full_adder` and `half_adder` components.
* Includes a Verilog testbench for simulation and verification.

## Architecture

The multiplier's architecture is based on the provided Block diagram and follows three main stages:

1.  **Partial Product Generation:** A 4x4 matrix of 16 partial products is generated by ANDing the bits of the two inputs.

2.  **Reduction Stages:** Two layers of parallel half adders and full adders (acting as a Carry-Save Adder network) compress the 16 partial products. This stage reduces the multiple rows of partial products down to just two rows of "survivor" bits (sum and carry bits).

3.  **Carry Propagate Adder Stage:** A final 8-bit Carry-Propagate Adder (implemented as a ripple-carry chain) performs the final addition on the two survivor rows to compute the single, final 8-bit product.
